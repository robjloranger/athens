# Pull Request Reviews

Whether you're contributing or reviewing pull requests, this document can help you!

- If you're reviewing, it can help you understand what to do
- If you're submitting a pull request, it can help you understand what folks
are going to do, how to help them, and how to get your pull request
merged faster

## Steps

We follow a lightweight list of steps in order to review 
[pull requests in the Athens project](https://github.com/gomods/athens/pulls)
(if you're not familiar with pull requests, see 
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)).

Here they are:

- Anyone, whether or not they are an official [contributor](https://github.com/orgs/gomods/teams/contributors),
  can review a pull request.
- Pull requests must be reviewed by at least one 
  [maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/gomods/teams/maintainers), enforced by GitHub.
  Only maintainers can merge a pull request.
- For important changes we want to make sure that people in other time zones have a chance to
    review, so keep the pull request open for 24-36 hours before merging.
- Pull requests have to pass continuous integration (CI) tests.
